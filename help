Don't directly use npm start. Use ./eHealthi.sh run prod or ./eHealthi.sh run dev to run in production, and development environments respectively. Doing so automatically fills in the environment variables before calling npm start.
Just execute the ./eHealthi.sh command to find out more on what it can do. For example, issue SSL certificates (using certbot), configure a service for automatically starting your app in production
You can edit the contents of dev.env and prod.env. They contain system configurations for development, and production environments.
Modify also, the contents of config/database.json to specify details of the database connections.
SSL configurations depend on config/platform.cer (certificate) and config/platform.key (private key), by default. These, can be changed in prod.env, and dev.env
